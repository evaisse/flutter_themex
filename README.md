# flutter_themex

A flutter sample proposal for managing themes, widgets, and theme extensions.

    - simple inheritance of styles
    - straightforward usages of styles definition
    - optional and modular extensions, always attached to the related widgets (allow plug'n'play widget+theming injection of components)
